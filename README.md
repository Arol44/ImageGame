ImageGame
=========
This is a program that I was asked to make when I was applying to Schooley Mitchell.
The requirements were to use PHP, Javascrpt (JQuery), HTML and CSS; and to:

1)Create a web page allowing an image to be uploaded. 

2) When the image is uploaded, split the image into at least 9 different pieces.

3) Display the pieces on screen but in a mixed up order.

4) Allow the user to then move the pieces into the proper order to reform the image.

5) The page should recognize and produce an output when the pieces are back in the proper order.
